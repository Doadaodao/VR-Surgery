   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Three-dimensional (3D) displays of anatomic structures have become feasible for preoperative planning in some surgical procedures. There have been no reports, however, on the use of 3D displays for surgical treatment of lung cancer. We hypothesized that 3D displays of the thorax are useful for preoperative planning for lung cancer. METHODS: Based on virtual reality technologies, we rendered 3D displays of the thorax from two-dimensional (2D) computed tomographic (CT) images of six anonymous patients, some of whom underwent surgical removal of lung cancer. For determining the resectability of lung cancer, we tested 17 participants with varying degrees of surgical skills to view 3D displays and read 2D CT images of these thoracic cavities in a randomized order. We measured their performance in terms of the accuracy of predicted resectability, the confidence of their prediction, planning time used, and workload experienced. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that viewing 3D displays of thoracic cavities has significant advantages over reading 2D CT images in determining the resectability of lung cancer: increasing the accuracy of predicted resectability by about 20%, enhancing the confidence of the prediction by about 20%, decreasing planning time by about 30%, and reducing workload by about 50%. All participants preferred viewing 3D displays to reading 2D CT images for preoperative planning. Junior residents found 3D displays of thoraces more useful than senior residents. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to use 3D displays of the thorax for preoperative planning in treating lung cancer. Using 3D displays in surgical treatment of lung cancer has potential benefits, once the technique is perfected.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the probability that a lung cancer arising in a segment has safety anatomical margin for segmentectomy by using a computed-tomography (CT)-based simulation technique. METHODS: We measured the volume of each segment by dividing a three-dimensional lung model into a segment model. We also measured the volume of particular portions of each segment that were located away from the intersegmental plane by a predefined distance according to a virtual tumor size of 1, 2, or 3 cm. The probability that a lung cancer arising in the segment has safety anatomical margin for segmentectomy (chance to accept segmentectomy) was expressed as the ratio of this particular portion to the entire segment. RESULTS: There was significant variability in segment size (smallest, the right medial-basal; largest, the left apicoposterior segment). The chance to accept segmentectomy depended on the segment size and the virtual tumor size; however, irrespective of segment size, there was only a small chance to accept segmentectomy in the bilateral lateral-basal and left anterior segments. Overall, the chance to accept segmentectomy for virtual tumors of 1, 2, and 3 cm in diameter was 33%, 24%, and 18%, respectively. Bisegmentectomy provided 49% chance in resecting virtual tumors that were 2 cm in diameter. CONCLUSION: The chance to accept segmentectomy differed greatly in individual segments; it was minimal if a segment was small or located between neighboring segments. Bisegmentectomy can increase the chance to accept segmentectomy. In addition to these results, our method is useful in identifying tumors having eligibility for segmentectomy.},

Patients and methods During the period from March 2011 to October 2013, 21 consecutive patients (8 females, 13 males, age range from 18month to 7years) were referred to the radiology department for CT evaluation for suspected FB inhalation. CT was done on a 16-slice scanner. No IV contrast was used. MDCT findings were compared with the results of rigid bronchoscopy. Results MDCT detected FB in 17 patients, two cases had true −ve results, one case had false +ve and one case had false −ve results compared with conventional bronchoscopy. MDCT revealed hyper-aeration of the ipsilateral lung in 42.9 % patients, atelectasis in 57.1%, pneumonic consolidation in 71.4%. According to bronchoscopy, foreign body was identified and extracted in 18 patients. The right main bronchus, left main bronchus and trachea were the commonest sites. Conclusion Multidetector CT with the aid of virtual bronchoscopy is a reliable noninvasive method that allows detection and localization of tracheobronchial FB.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracic surgery is gradually replacing conventional open thoracotomy as the method of choice for the treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancers, and thoracic surgical trainees must learn and master this technique. Simulation-based training could help trainees overcome the first part of the learning curve, but no virtual-reality simulators for thoracoscopy are commercially available. This study aimed to investigate whether training on a laparoscopic simulator enables trainees to perform a thoracoscopic lobectomy. METHODS: Twenty-eight surgical residents were randomized to either virtual-reality training on a nephrectomy module or traditional black-box simulator training. After a retention period they performed a thoracoscopic lobectomy on a porcine model and their performance was scored using a previously validated assessment tool. RESULTS: The groups did not differ in age or gender. All participants were able to complete the lobectomy. The performance of the black-box group was significantly faster during the test scenario than the virtual-reality group: 26.6 min (SD 6.7 min) versus 32.7 min (SD 7.5 min). No difference existed between the two groups when comparing bleeding and anatomical and non-anatomical errors. CONCLUSION: Simulation-based training and targeted instructions enabled the trainees to perform a simulated thoracoscopic lobectomy. Traditional black-box training was more effective than virtual-reality laparoscopy training. Thus, a dedicated simulator for thoracoscopy should be available before establishing systematic virtual-reality training programs for trainees in thoracic surgery.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quickly and accurately localizing small peripheral pulmonary lesions can avoid prolonged operative time and unplanned open thoracotomy. In this study, we aimed to introduce and evaluate a new technique combining virtual simulation and methylene blue staining for the localization of small peripheral pulmonary lesions. METHODS: Seventy four (74) patients with 80 peripheral pulmonary lesions <20 mm in size on computer tomography (CT) were virtually punctured using a radiotherapy planning simulator on the day before operation. Under general anaesthesia, methylene blue dye was injected to the virtually identified point according to the surface point, angle and depth previously determined by the simulator. The wedge resection of the marked lesion was performed under video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and the specimens were sent for immediate pathologic examination. According to pathology results, appropriate surgical procedures were decided and undertaken. RESULTS: The average lesion size was 10.4±3.5 mm (range: 4-17 mm) and the average distance to the pleural surface was 9.4±4.9 mm. Our preoperative localization procedure was successful in 75 of 80 (94%) lesions. Histological examination showed 28 benign lesions and 52 lung cancers. The shortest distance between the edges of the stain and lesion was 5.1±3.1 mm. Localization time was 17.4±2.3 min. All patients with malignant lesions subsequently underwent lobectomy and systematic lymph node dissection. No complications were observed in all participants. CONCLUSIONS: The novel technique combining the preoperative virtual simulation and methylene blue staining techniques has a high success rate for localizing small peripheral pulmonary lesions, particularly for those tiny lesions which are difficult to visualise and palpate during VATS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to develop virtual reality simulation software for video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy, to explore the opinions of thoracic surgeons concerning the VATS lobectomy simulator and to test the validity of the simulator metrics. METHODS: Experienced VATS surgeons worked with computer specialists to develop a VATS lobectomy software for a virtual reality simulator. Thoracic surgeons with different degrees of experience in VATS were enrolled at the 22nd meeting of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) held in Copenhagen in June 2014. The surgeons were divided according to the number of performed VATS lobectomies: novices (0 VATS lobectomies), intermediates (1-49 VATS lobectomies) and experienced (>50 VATS lobectomies). The participants all performed a lobectomy of a right upper lobe on the simulator and answered a questionnaire regarding content validity. Metrics were compared between the three groups. RESULTS: We succeeded in developing the first version of a virtual reality VATS lobectomy simulator. A total of 103 thoracic surgeons completed the simulated lobectomy and were distributed as follows: novices n = 32, intermediates n = 45 and experienced n = 26. All groups rated the overall user realism of the VATS lobectomy scenario to a median of 5 on a scale 1-7, with 7 being the best score. The experienced surgeons found the graphics and movements realistic and rated the scenario high in terms of usefulness as a training tool for novice and intermediate experienced thoracic surgeons, but not very useful as a training tool for experienced surgeons. The metric scores were not statistically significant between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to describe a commercially available virtual reality simulator for a VATS lobectomy. More than 100 thoracic surgeons found the simulator realistic, and hence it showed good content validity. However, none of the built-in simulator metrics could significantly distinguish between novice, intermediate experienced and experienced surgeons, and further development of the simulator software is necessary to develop valid metrics.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Virtual-assisted lung mapping (VAL-MAP) is a preoperative bronchoscopic multispot dye-marking technique using virtual images. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy and reproducibility of VAL-MAP among multiple centres. METHODS: Selection criteria included patients with pulmonary lesions anticipated to be difficult to identify at thoracoscopy and/or those undergoing sub-lobar lung resections requiring careful determination of resection margins. Data were collected prospectively and, if needed, compared between the centre that originally developed VAL-MAP and 16 other centres. RESULTS: Five hundred patients underwent VAL-MAP with 1781 markings (3.6 ± 1.2 marks/patient). Complications associated with VAL-MAP necessitating additional management occurred in four patients (0.8%) including pneumonia, fever and temporary exacerbation of pre-existing cerebral ischaemia. Minor complications included pneumothorax (3.6%), pneumomediastinum (1.2%) and alveolar haemorrhage (1.2%), with similar incidences between the original centre and other centres. Marks were identifiable during operation in approximately 90%, whereas the successful resection rate was approximately 99% in both groups, partly due to the mutually complementary marks. The contribution of VAL-MAP to surgical success was highly rated by surgeons resecting pure ground glass nodules ( P  < 0.0001), tumours ≤ 5 mm ( P  = 0.0016), and performing complex segmentectomy and wedge resection ( P  = 0.0072). CONCLUSIONS: VAL-MAP was found to be safe and reproducible among multiple centres with variable settings. Patients with pure ground glass nodules, small tumours and resections beyond conventional anatomical boundaries are considered the best candidates for VAL-MAP.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Procedural simulation training is rare at the medical school level and little is known about its usefulness in improving anatomic understanding and procedural confidence in students. Our aim is to assess the impact of bronchoscopy simulation training on bronchial anatomy knowledge and technical skills in medical students. METHODS: Medical students were recruited by email, consented, and asked to fill out a survey regarding their baseline experience. Two thoracic surgeons measured their knowledge of bronchoscopy on a virtual reality bronchoscopy simulator using the Bronchoscopy Skills and Tasks Assessment Tool (BSTAT), a validated 65-point checklist (46 for anatomy, 19 for simulation). Students performed four self-directed training sessions of 15 minutes per week. A posttraining survey and BSTAT were completed afterward. Differences between pretraining and posttraining scores were analyzed with paired Student's t tests and random intercept linear regression models accounting for baseline BSTAT score, total training time, and training year. RESULTS: The study was completed by 47 medical students with a mean training time of 81.5 ± 26.8 minutes. Mean total BSTAT score increased significantly from 12.3 ± 5.9 to 48.0 ± 12.9 (p < 0.0001); mean scores for bronchial anatomy increased from 0.1 ± 0.9 to 31.1 ± 12.3 (p < 0.0001); and bronchoscopy navigational skills increased from 12.1 ± 5.7 to 17.4 ± 2.5 (p < 0.0001). Total training time and frequency of training did not have a significant impact on level of improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Self-driven bronchoscopy simulation training in medical students led to improvements in bronchial anatomy knowledge and bronchoscopy skills. Further investigation is under way to determine the impact of bronchoscopy simulation training on future specialty interest and long-term skills retention.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Virtual-assisted lung mapping is a preoperative bronchoscopic multi-spot dye-marking technique. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of virtual-assisted lung mapping for obtaining sufficient surgical margins in sublobar lung resection. METHODS: The multicenter, prospective, single-arm study was conducted from September 2016 to July 2017 in 19 registered centers. Patients who required sublobar lung resection and careful determination of resection margins underwent virtual-assisted lung mapping followed by thoracoscopic surgery. Successful resection was defined as resection of the lesion with margins greater than the lesion diameter or 2 cm using the preoperatively planned resection without additional resection. We defined the primary goal of the study as achieving successful resection in 95% of lesions. RESULTS: The resection of 203 lesions (average diameter, 9.6 ± 5.3 mm) was intended in 153 patients. The lesions included pure and mixed ground-glass nodules (75 [35.9%] and 36 [17.2%], respectively), solid nodules (91 [43.5%]), and others (7 [3.3%]). Surgical procedures included wedge resection (131, 71.2%), segmentectomy (51, 27.7%), and others (2, 1.1%). Successful resection was achieved in 178 lesions (87.8% [95% confidence interval, 82.4-91.9%]), and virtual-assisted lung mapping markings successfully aided in the identification of 190 lesions (93.6% [95% confidence interval, 89.3-96.5%]). Multivariable analysis showed that the most significant factor affecting resection success was the depth of the necessary resection margin (P = .0072). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that virtual-assisted lung mapping has reasonable efficacy, although the successful resection rate did not reach the primary goal. The depth of the required margin was the most significant factor leading to resection failure.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study is to develop and assess the peg transfer training module face, content and construct validation use of the box, virtual reality (VR), cognitive virtual reality (CVR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) trainer, thereby to compare advantages and disadvantages of these simulators. Training system (VatsSim-XR) design includes customized haptic-enabled thoracoscopic instruments, virtual reality helmet set, endoscope kit with navigation, and the patient-specific corresponding training environment. A cohort of 32 trainees comprising 24 novices and 8 experts underwent the real and virtual simulators that were conducted in the department of thoracic surgery of Yunnan First People's Hospital. Both subjective and objective evaluations have been developed to explore the visual and haptic potential promotions in peg transfer education. Experiments and evaluation results conducted by both professional and novice thoracic surgeons show that the surgery skills from experts are better than novices overall, AR trainer is able to provide a more balanced training environments on visuohaptic fidelity and accuracy, box trainer and MR trainer demonstrated the best realism 3D perception and surgical immersive performance, respectively, and CVR trainer shows a better clinic effect that the traditional VR trainer. Combining these in a systematic approach, tuned with specific fidelity requirements, medical simulation systems would be able to provide a more immersive and effective training environment.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: With the availability of low-cost head-mounted displays (HMDs), virtual reality environments (VREs) are increasingly being used in medicine for teaching and clinical purposes. Our aim was to develop an interactive, user-friendly VRE for tridimensional visualization of patient-specific organs, establishing a workflow to transfer 3-dimensional (3D) models from imaging datasets to our immersive VRE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This original VRE model was built using open-source software and a mobile HMD, Samsung Gear VR. For its validation, we enrolled 33 volunteers: morphologists (n = 11), trainee surgeons (n = 15), and expert surgeons (n = 7). They tried our VRE and then filled in an original 5-point Likert-type scale 6-item questionnaire, considering the following parameters: ease of use, anatomy comprehension compared with 2D radiological imaging, explanation of anatomical variations, explanation of surgical procedures, preoperative planning, and experience of gastrointestinal/neurological disorders. Results in the 3 groups were statistically compared using analysis of variance. RESULTS: Using cross-sectional medical imaging, the developed VRE allowed to visualize a 3D patient-specific abdominal scene in 1 hour. Overall, the 6 items were evaluated positively by all groups; only anatomy comprehension was statistically significant different among the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach, based on open-source software and mobile hardware, proved to be a valid and well-appreciated system to visualize 3D patient-specific models, paving the way for a potential new tool for teaching and preoperative planning.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Training for robot-assisted thoracic lobectomy remains an issue, prompting the development of virtual reality simulators. Our aim was to assess the construct and face validity of a new thoracic lobectomy module on the RobotiX Mentor, a robotic surgery simulator. We also aimed to determine the acceptability and feasibility of implementation into training. METHODS: This prospective, observational, and comparative study recruited novice (n = 16), intermediate (n = 9), and expert (n = 5) participants from King's College London, the 25th European Conference on General Thoracic Surgery, and the Society of Robotic Surgery conference 2018. Each participant completed two familiarization tasks followed by the Guided Robotic Lobectomy module and an evaluation questionnaire. Outcome measures were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Construct validity was demonstrated in 12/21 performance evaluation metrics. Significant differences between groups were found in all metrics including: time taken to complete module, vascular injury, respect for tissue, number of stapler firings, time instruments out of view, number of instrument collisions, and number of movements. Participants deemed aspects of the simulator (mean 3/5) and module (3/5) as realistic and rated the simulator as both acceptable (3.8/5) and feasible (3.8/5) for robotic surgical training. CONCLUSIONS: Face validity, acceptability, and feasibility were established for the thoracic lobectomy module of the RobotiX Mentor simulator. Moderate evidence of construct validity was also demonstrated. With further work, this simulation module could help to reduce the initial part of the learning curve for trainees and decrease the risk of errors during live training.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been an increasing trend toward pulmonary segmentectomies to treat early-stage lung cancer, small intrapulmonary metastases, and localized benign pathology. A complete preoperative understanding of pulmonary anatomy is essential for accurate surgical planning and case selection. Identifying intersegmental divisions is extremely difficult when performed on computed tomography. For the preoperative planning of segmentectomies, virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence could allow 3-dimensional visualization of the complex anatomy of pulmonary segmental divisions, vascular arborization, and bronchial anatomy. This technology can be applied by surgeons preoperatively to gain better insight into a patient's anatomy for planning segmentectomy. METHODS: In this prospective observational pilot study, we aim to assess and demonstrate the technical feasibility and clinical applicability of the first dedicated artificial intelligence-based and immersive 3-dimensional-VR platform (PulmoVR; jointly developed and manufactured by Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery [Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands], MedicalVR [Amsterdam, The Netherlands], EVOCS Medical Image Communication [Fysicon BV, Oss, The Netherlands], and Thirona [Nijmegen, The Netherlands]) for preoperative planning of video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomies. RESULTS: A total of 10 eligible patients for segmentectomy were included in this study after referral through the institutional thoracic oncology multidisciplinary team. PulmoVR was successfully applied as a supplementary imaging tool to perform video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomies. In 40% of the cases, the surgical strategy was adjusted due to the 3-dimensional-VR-based evaluation of anatomy. This underlines the potential benefit of additional VR-guided planning of segmentectomy for both surgeon and patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the successful development and clinical application of the first dedicated artificial intelligence and VR platform for the planning of pulmonary segmentectomy. This is the first study that shows an immersive virtual reality-based application for preoperative planning of segmentectomy to the best of our knowledge.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has become a standard approach for the treatment of lung cancer. However, its minimally invasive nature limits the field of view and reduces tactile feedback. These limitations make it vital that surgeons thoroughly familiarize themselves with the patient's anatomy preoperatively. We have developed a virtual reality (VR) surgical navigation system using head-mounted displays (HMD). The aim of this study was to investigate the potential utility of this VR simulation system in both preoperative planning and intraoperative assistance, including support during thoracoscopic sublobar resection. METHODS: Three-dimensional (3D) polygon data derived from preoperative computed tomography data was loaded into BananaVision software developed at Colorado State University and displayed on an HMD. An interactive 3D reconstruction image was created, in which all the pulmonary structures could be individually imaged. Preoperative resection simulations were performed with patient-individualized reconstructed 3D images. RESULTS: The 3D anatomic structure of pulmonary vessels and a clear vision into the space between the lesion and adjacent tissues were successfully appreciated during preoperative simulation. Surgeons could easily evaluate the real patient's anatomy in preoperative simulations to improve the accuracy and safety of actual surgery. The VR software and HMD allowed surgeons to visualize and interact with real patient data in true 3D providing a unique perspective. CONCLUSIONS: This initial experience suggests that a VR simulation with HMD facilitated preoperative simulation. Routine imaging modalities combined with VR systems could substantially improve preoperative planning and contribute to the safety and accuracy of anatomic resection.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Extended reality (XR), encompassing both virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality, allows the user to interact with a computer-generated environment based on reality. In essence, the immersive nature of VR and augmented reality technology has been warmly welcomed in all aspects of medicine, gradually becoming increasingly feasible to incorporate into everyday practice. In recent years, XR has become increasingly adopted in thoracic surgery, although the extent of its applications is unclear. Here, we aim to review the current applications of XR in thoracic surgery. METHODS: A systematic database search was conducted of original articles that explored the use of VR and/or augmented reality in thoracic surgery in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane database and Google Scholar, from inception to December 2020. RESULTS: Our search yielded 1494 citations, of which 21 studies published from 2007 to 2019 were included in this review. Three main areas were identified: (i) the application of XR in thoracic surgery training; (ii) preoperative planning of thoracic procedures; and (iii) intraoperative assistance. Overall, XR could produce progression along the learning curve, enabling trainees to reach acceptable standards before performing in the operating theatre. Preoperatively, through the generation of 3D-renderings of the thoracic cavity and lung anatomy, VR increases procedural accuracy and surgical confidence through familiarization of the patient's anatomy. XR-assisted surgery may have therapeutic use particularly for complex cases, where conventional methods would yield inadequate outcomes due to inferior accuracy. CONCLUSION: XR represents a salient step towards improving thoracic surgical training, as well as enhancing preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: When surgical resection is indicated for a congenital lung abnormality (CLA), lobectomy is often preferred over segmentectomy, mostly because the latter is associated with more residual disease. Presumably, this occurs in children because sublobar surgery often does not adhere to anatomical borders (wedge resection instead of segmentectomy), thus increasing the risk of residual disease. This study investigated the feasibility of identifying eligible cases for anatomical segmentectomy by combining virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI). METHODS: Semi-automated segmentation of bronchovascular structures and lesions were visualized with VR and AI technology. Two specialists independently evaluated via a questionnaire the informative value of regular computed tomography versus three-dimensional (3D) VR images. RESULTS: Five asymptomatic, non-operated cases were selected. Bronchovascular segmentation, volume calculation and image visualization in the VR environment were successful in all cases. Based on the computed tomography images, assignment of the CLA lesion to specific lung segments matched between the consulted specialists in only 1 out of the cases. Based on the three 3D VR images, however, the localization matched in 3 of the 5 cases. If the patients would have been operated, adding the 3D VR tool to the preoperative workup would have resulted in changing the surgical strategy (i.e. lobectomy versus segmentectomy) in 4 cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the technical feasibility of a hybridized AI-VR visualization of segment-level lung anatomy in patients with CLA. Further exploration of the value of 3D VR in identifying eligible cases for anatomical segmentectomy is therefore warranted.},

   abstract = {Video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been adopted in pediatric age for the treatment of congenital lung malformations (CLM). The success of VATS in pediatrics largely depends on the surgeon's skill ability to understand the airways, vascular system and lung parenchyma anatomy in CLM. In the last years, virtual reality (VR) and 3-dimensional (3D) printing of organ models and VR head mounted display (HMD) technologies have been introduced for completion of preoperative planning in adult patients. To date no reports about the use of VR HMD technologies in a pediatric setting are available. The aim of this report is to introduce a VR HMD model in VATS procedure to improve the quality of care in children with CLM. VR HMD set-up for planning thoracoscopic surgery was performed in a series of pediatric patients with diagnosis of CLM. The preoperative VR HMD evaluation allowed a navigation into the malformation with the aim to explore, interact, and make the surgeon more confident and skilled to answer to the traps. A development of surgical simulations models and teaching program dedicated to education and training in pediatric VATS is suitable among the pediatric surgery community. Further studies should demonstrate all the benefits of such technology in pediatric patients submitted to VATS procedure.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Chest wall resections for lung cancer treatment remain difficult to plan using standard 2-dimensional computed tomography. Although virtual reality headsets have been used in many medical contexts, they have not been used in chest wall resection planning. DESCRIPTION: We compared preoperative planning of a chest wall surgical resection for lung cancer treatment between senior and resident surgeons who used an immersive virtual reality device and a 2-dimensional computed tomography. EVALUATION: Chest wall resection planning was more accurate when surgeons used virtual reality vs computed tomography analysis (28.6% vs 18.3%, P = .018), and this was particularly true in the resident surgeon group (27.4% vs 8.3%, P = .0025). Predictions regarding the need for chest wall substitutes were also more accurate when they were made using virtual reality vs computed tomography analysis in all groups (96% vs 68.5%, P < .0001). Other studied parameters were not affected by the use of the virtual reality tool. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality may offer enhanced accuracy for chest wall resection and reconstruction planning for lung cancer treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lately, increased interest in pulmonary segmentectomy has been observed. Segmental border identification is extremely difficult on 2-dimensional computed tomography (CT). Preoperative application of virtual reality (VR) can provide better insight into patient-specific anatomy. The aim of this study was to investigate the added clinical value of 3-dimensional (3D) VR using PulmoVR for preoperative planning. METHODS: Patients with an indication for pulmonary segmentectomy were included between June 2020 and September 2021 at the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. CT scans were (semi)automatically segmented to visualize lung segments, segmental arteries, veins, and bronchi. Three surgeons made a surgical plan on the basis of the conventional CT scan and subsequently analyzed the VR visualization. The primary outcome was the incidence of critical (ensuring radical resection) preoperative plan modifications. Secondarily, data on observed anatomic variation and perioperative (oncologic) outcomes were collected. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients (median age at surgery, 65 years [interquartile range, 17.25 years]) with an indication for pulmonary segmentectomy were included. After supplemental VR visualization, the surgical plan was adjusted in 52%; the tumor was localized in a different segment in 14%, more lung-sparing resection was planned in 10%, and extended segmentectomy, including 1 lobectomy, was planned in 28%. Pathologic examination confirmed radical resection in 49 patients (98%). CONCLUSIONS: This 3D VR technology showed added clinical value in the first 50 VR-guided segmentectomies because a 52% change of plan with 98% radical resection was observed. Furthermore, 3D VR visualization of the bronchovasculature, including various anatomic variations, provided better insight into patient-specific anatomy and offered lung-sparing possibilities with more certainty.},

   abstract = {Background. Immersive virtual reality (iVR) facilitates surgical decision-making by enabling surgeons to interact with complex anatomic structures in realistic 3-dimensional environments. With emerging interest in its applications, its effects on patients and providers should be clarified. This systematic review examines the current literature on iVR for patient-specific preoperative planning. Materials and Methods. A literature search was performed on five databases for publications from January 1, 2000 through March 21, 2021. Primary studies on the use of iVR simulators by surgeons at any level of training for patient-specific preoperative planning were eligible. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, extracted data, and assessed quality using the Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs (QATSDD). Results were qualitatively synthesized, and descriptive statistics were calculated. Results. The systematic search yielded 2,555 studies in total, with 24 full-texts subsequently included for qualitative synthesis, representing 264 medical personnel and 460 patients. Neurosurgery was the most frequently represented discipline (10/24; 42%). Preoperative iVR did not significantly improve patient-specific outcomes of operative time, blood loss, complications, and length of stay, but may decrease fluoroscopy time. In contrast, iVR improved surgeon-specific outcomes of surgical strategy, anatomy visualization, and confidence. Validity, reliability, and feasibility of patient-specific iVR models were assessed. The mean QATSDD score of included studies was 32.9%. Conclusions. Immersive VR improves surgeon experiences of preoperative planning, with minimal evidence for impact on short-term patient outcomes. Future work should focus on high-quality studies investigating long-term patient outcomes, and utility of preoperative iVR for trainees.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To describe our experience using virtual reality (VR) and three-dimensional (3D) printing as complements for the surgical planning process of slide tracheoplasty (ST) in patients with congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS). Description: VR and 3D printing are used for the surgical planning of ST as a therapeutic option in three female patients under five years of age with CTS. Evaluation: We assessed the planned surgical procedure, procedural time, postoperative complications, and outcomes, as well as the main surgeon's experience with the use of the applied technologies. Conclusions: The interaction within the VR environment allowed for collaboration of the surgical plan between surgical staff and enhancement of the radiologist-surgeon communication, while procedural simulation with 3D printing prototypes allowed for refining technical abilities for the surgical interventions. Based on our experience, the application of these technologies have added value to the surgical planning of ST and its outcomes in the treatment of CTS.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Virtual reality (VR) technology has emerged as a promising tool for physicians, offering the ability to assess anatomical data in 3D with visuospatial interaction qualities. The last decade has witnessed a remarkable increase in the number of studies focusing on the application of VR to assess patient-specific image data. This systematic review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the latest research on VR in the field of surgical planning. APPROACH: A comprehensive literature search was conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses covering the period from April 1, 2021 to May 10, 2023. It includes research articles reporting on preoperative surgical planning using patient-specific medical images in virtual reality using head-mounted displays. The review summarizes the current state of research in this field, identifying key findings, technologies, study designs, methods, and potential directions for future research. RESULTS: The selected studies show a positive impact on surgical decision-making and anatomy understanding compared to other visualization modalities. A substantial number of studies are reporting anecdotal evidence and case-specific outcomes. Notably, surgical planning using VR led to more frequent changes in surgical plans compared to planning with other visualization methods when surgeons reassessed their initial plans. VR demonstrated benefits in reducing planning time and improving spatial localization of pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that the application of VR for surgical planning is still in an experimental stage but is gradually advancing toward clinical use. The diverse study designs, methodologies, and varying reporting hinder a comprehensive analysis. Some findings lack statistical evidence and rely on subjective assumptions. To strengthen evaluation, future research should focus on refining study designs, improving technical reporting, defining visual and technical proficiency requirements, and enhancing VR software usability and design. Addressing these areas could pave the way for an effective implementation of VR in clinical settings.},

   abstract = {Background. Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) is now standard for lung cancer treatment, offering advantages over traditional methods. However, RATS's minimally invasive approach poses challenges like limited visibility and tactile feedback, affecting surgeons' navigation through com-plex anatomy. To enhance preoperative familiarization with patient-specific anatomy, we devel-oped a virtual reality (VR) surgical navigation system. Using head-mounted displays (HMDs), this system provides a comprehensive, interactive view of the patient's anatomy pre-surgery, aiming to improve preoperative simulation and intraoperative navigation. Methods. We integrated 3D data from preoperative CT scans into Perspectus VR Education software, displayed via HMDs for in-teractive 3D reconstruction of pulmonary structures. This detailed visualization aids in tailored preoperative resection simulations. During RATS, surgeons access these 3D images through Tile-Pro(TM) multi-display for real-time guidance. Results. The VR system enabled precise visualization of pulmonary structures and lesion relations, enhancing surgical safety and accuracy. The HMDs offered true 3D interaction with patient data, facilitating surgical planning. Conclusions. VR sim-ulation with HMDs, akin to a robotic 3D viewer, offers a novel approach to developing robotic surgical skills. Integrated with routine imaging, it improves preoperative planning, safety, and accuracy of anatomical resections. This technology particularly aids in lesion identification in RATS, optimizing surgical outcomes.},
