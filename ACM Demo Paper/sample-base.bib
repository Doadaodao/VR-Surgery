   abstract = {The aims of this study were to develop virtual reality simulation software for video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy, to explore the opinions of thoracic surgeons concerning the VATS lobectomy simulator and to test the validity of the simulator metrics.Experienced VATS surgeons worked with computer specialists to develop a VATS lobectomy software for a virtual reality simulator. Thoracic surgeons with different degrees of experience in VATS were enrolled at the 22nd meeting of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) held in Copenhagen in June 2014. The surgeons were divided according to the number of performed VATS lobectomies: novices (0 VATS lobectomies), intermediates (1–49 VATS lobectomies) and experienced (&gt;50 VATS lobectomies). The participants all performed a lobectomy of a right upper lobe on the simulator and answered a questionnaire regarding content validity. Metrics were compared between the three groups.We succeeded in developing the first version of a virtual reality VATS lobectomy simulator. A total of 103 thoracic surgeons completed the simulated lobectomy and were distributed as follows: novices n = 32, intermediates n = 45 and experienced n = 26. All groups rated the overall user realism of the VATS lobectomy scenario to a median of 5 on a scale 1–7, with 7 being the best score. The experienced surgeons found the graphics and movements realistic and rated the scenario high in terms of usefulness as a training tool for novice and intermediate experienced thoracic surgeons, but not very useful as a training tool for experienced surgeons. The metric scores were not statistically significant between groups.This is the first study to describe a commercially available virtual reality simulator for a VATS lobectomy. More than 100 thoracic surgeons found the simulator realistic, and hence it showed good content validity. However, none of the built-in simulator metrics could significantly distinguish between novice, intermediate experienced and experienced surgeons, and further development of the simulator software is necessary to develop valid metrics.},

   abstract = {Surgical planning software is a key component in the treatment of tumor diseases. However, desktop-based systems provide only limited visualization and interaction opportunities. Moreover, collaborative planning among members of a surgical team is only possible to a limited extent. In this work, a collaborative virtual reality (VR) environment to assist liver surgeons in tumor surgery planning is presented. Our aim is to improve virtual resection planning between surgeons in a remote or co-located environment. The system allows surgeons to define and adjust virtual resections on patient-specific organ 3D surfaces and 2D image slices. Changes on both modalities are synchronized, which will enable surgeons to iterate and refine the resection surfaces quickly. In addition, a real-time risk map visualization is presented that displays safety margins around tumors. An evaluation performed by liver surgeons provides information on potential benefits, such as the possibility to visualize complex cases and assessing the safety-critical areas, applicability, and limitations for further improvement.},

   title = {Virtual reality and artificial intelligence for 3-dimensional planning of lung segmentectomies},
   journal = {JTCVS Tech},
   volume = {7},
   pages = {309-321},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been an increasing trend toward pulmonary segmentectomies to treat early-stage lung cancer, small intrapulmonary metastases, and localized benign pathology. A complete preoperative understanding of pulmonary anatomy is essential for accurate surgical planning and case selection. Identifying intersegmental divisions is extremely difficult when performed on computed tomography. For the preoperative planning of segmentectomies, virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence could allow 3-dimensional visualization of the complex anatomy of pulmonary segmental divisions, vascular arborization, and bronchial anatomy. This technology can be applied by surgeons preoperatively to gain better insight into a patient's anatomy for planning segmentectomy. METHODS: In this prospective observational pilot study, we aim to assess and demonstrate the technical feasibility and clinical applicability of the first dedicated artificial intelligence-based and immersive 3-dimensional-VR platform (PulmoVR; jointly developed and manufactured by Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery [Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands], MedicalVR [Amsterdam, The Netherlands], EVOCS Medical Image Communication [Fysicon BV, Oss, The Netherlands], and Thirona [Nijmegen, The Netherlands]) for preoperative planning of video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomies. RESULTS: A total of 10 eligible patients for segmentectomy were included in this study after referral through the institutional thoracic oncology multidisciplinary team. PulmoVR was successfully applied as a supplementary imaging tool to perform video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomies. In 40% of the cases, the surgical strategy was adjusted due to the 3-dimensional-VR-based evaluation of anatomy. This underlines the potential benefit of additional VR-guided planning of segmentectomy for both surgeon and patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the successful development and clinical application of the first dedicated artificial intelligence and VR platform for the planning of pulmonary segmentectomy. This is the first study that shows an immersive virtual reality-based application for preoperative planning of segmentectomy to the best of our knowledge.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lately, increased interest in pulmonary segmentectomy has been observed. Segmental border identification is extremely difficult on 2-dimensional computed tomography (CT). Preoperative application of virtual reality (VR) can provide better insight into patient-specific anatomy. The aim of this study was to investigate the added clinical value of 3-dimensional (3D) VR using PulmoVR for preoperative planning. METHODS: Patients with an indication for pulmonary segmentectomy were included between June 2020 and September 2021 at the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. CT scans were (semi)automatically segmented to visualize lung segments, segmental arteries, veins, and bronchi. Three surgeons made a surgical plan on the basis of the conventional CT scan and subsequently analyzed the VR visualization. The primary outcome was the incidence of critical (ensuring radical resection) preoperative plan modifications. Secondarily, data on observed anatomic variation and perioperative (oncologic) outcomes were collected. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients (median age at surgery, 65 years [interquartile range, 17.25 years]) with an indication for pulmonary segmentectomy were included. After supplemental VR visualization, the surgical plan was adjusted in 52%; the tumor was localized in a different segment in 14%, more lung-sparing resection was planned in 10%, and extended segmentectomy, including 1 lobectomy, was planned in 28%. Pathologic examination confirmed radical resection in 49 patients (98%). CONCLUSIONS: This 3D VR technology showed added clinical value in the first 50 VR-guided segmentectomies because a 52% change of plan with 98% radical resection was observed. Furthermore, 3D VR visualization of the bronchovasculature, including various anatomic variations, provided better insight into patient-specific anatomy and offered lung-sparing possibilities with more certainty.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Chest wall resections for lung cancer treatment remain difficult to plan using standard 2-dimensional computed tomography. Although virtual reality headsets have been used in many medical contexts, they have not been used in chest wall resection planning. DESCRIPTION: We compared preoperative planning of a chest wall surgical resection for lung cancer treatment between senior and resident surgeons who used an immersive virtual reality device and a 2-dimensional computed tomography. EVALUATION: Chest wall resection planning was more accurate when surgeons used virtual reality vs computed tomography analysis (28.6% vs 18.3%, P = .018), and this was particularly true in the resident surgeon group (27.4% vs 8.3%, P = .0025). Predictions regarding the need for chest wall substitutes were also more accurate when they were made using virtual reality vs computed tomography analysis in all groups (96% vs 68.5%, P < .0001). Other studied parameters were not affected by the use of the virtual reality tool. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality may offer enhanced accuracy for chest wall resection and reconstruction planning for lung cancer treatment.},
