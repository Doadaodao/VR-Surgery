Thoracic surgeons with different degrees of experience in VATS were enrolled at the 22nd meeting of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) held in Copenhagen in June 2014. The surgeons were divided according to the number of performed VATS lobectomies: novices (0 VATS lobectomies), intermediates (1–49 VATS lobectomies) and experienced (&gt;50 VATS lobectomies). The participants all performed a lobectomy of a right upper lobe on the simulator and answered a questionnaire regarding content validity. Metrics were compared between the three groups.We succeeded in developing the first version of a virtual reality VATS lobectomy simulator. A total of 103 thoracic surgeons completed the simulated lobectomy and were distributed as follows: novices n = 32, intermediates n = 45 and experienced n = 26. All groups rated the overall user realism of the VATS lobectomy scenario to a median of 5 on a scale 1–7, with 7 being the best score. The experienced surgeons found the graphics and movements realistic and rated the scenario high in terms of usefulness as a training tool for novice and intermediate experienced thoracic surgeons, but not very useful as a training tool for experienced surgeons. The metric scores were not statistically significant between groups.This is the first study to describe a commercially available virtual reality simulator for a VATS lobectomy. More than 100 thoracic surgeons found the simulator realistic, and hence it showed good content validity. However, none of the built-in simulator metrics could significantly distinguish between novice, intermediate experienced and experienced surgeons, and further development of the simulator software is necessary to develop valid metrics.},

   abstract = {Abstract This study was designed to determine whether an interactive three-dimensional presentation depicting liver and biliary anatomy is more effective for teaching medical students than a traditional textbook format presentation of the same material. Forty-six medical students volunteered for participation in this study. Baseline demographic information, spatial ability, and knowledge of relevant anatomy were measured. Participants were randomized into two groups and presented with a computer-based interactive learning module comprised of animations and still images to highlight various anatomical structures (3D group), or a computer-based text document containing the same images and text without animation or interactive features (2D group). Following each teaching module, students completed a satisfaction survey and nine-item anatomic knowledge post-test. The 3D group scored higher on the post-test than the 2D group, with a mean score of 74% and 64%, respectively; however, when baseline differences in pretest scores were accounted for, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.33). Spatial ability did not statistically significantly correlate with post-test scores for the 3D group or the 2D group. In the post-test satisfaction survey the 3D group expressed a statistically significantly higher overall satisfaction rating compared to students in the 2D control group (4.5 versus 3.7 out of 5, P = 0.02). While the interactive 3D multimedia module received higher satisfaction ratings from students, it neither enhanced nor inhibited learning of complex hepatobiliary anatomy compared to an informationally equivalent traditional textbook style approach.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). SETTING: Academic obstetrics and gynecology resident training program. INTERVENTIONS: Traditional independent study curriculum versus traditional curriculum and VisCubeSX VR curriculum MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Residents were randomized, stratified by year of training, in a 1:1 fashion to traditional independent study curriculum for pelvic anatomy versus traditional curriculum and the VisCubeSX VR anatomic model. Tests were administered to assess baseline and postintervention knowledge. A postintervention assessment of the VisCubeSX VR anatomic model was performed. Baseline, follow-up, and score improvement were compared between groups using Student t tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Thirty-one residents were randomized. There was a significant improvement in pre- and post-test scores within traditional independent study curriculum participants, 8.1 ± 12.0 points (p = .02), and the VisCubeSX group 8.7 ± 6.4 points (p <.001), but these improvements did not differ between groups (p = .86). This lack of between-group differences was consistent in resident year-stratified analyses. Residents exposed to the VisCubeSX VR anatomic model reported they "somewhat" or "strongly agree" (15/16 [93.8%] and 14/16 [87.5%] of residents, respectively) that the model improved their knowledge of pelvic anatomy and that the model will improve patient care. CONCLUSION: Few studies exist that compare educational outcomes of a traditional independent study of female pelvic anatomy curriculum versus immersive simulation with VR models in female pelvic anatomy. Knowledge scores were not significantly increased with the VR model compared with traditional curriculum, but VR technology was perceived as an enhancement to short-term learning.},

Moreover, collaborative planning among members of a surgical team is only possible to a limited extent. In this work, a collaborative virtual reality (VR) environment to assist liver surgeons in tumor surgery planning is presented. Our aim is to improve virtual resection planning between surgeons in a remote or co-located environment. The system allows surgeons to define and adjust virtual resections on patient-specific organ 3D surfaces and 2D image slices. Changes on both modalities are synchronized, which will enable surgeons to iterate and refine the resection surfaces quickly. In addition, a real-time risk map visualization is presented that displays safety margins around tumors. An evaluation performed by liver surgeons provides information on potential benefits, such as the possibility to visualize complex cases and assessing the safety-critical areas, applicability, and limitations for further improvement.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been an increasing trend toward pulmonary segmentectomies to treat early-stage lung cancer, small intrapulmonary metastases, and localized benign pathology. A complete preoperative understanding of pulmonary anatomy is essential for accurate surgical planning and case selection. Identifying intersegmental divisions is extremely difficult when performed on computed tomography. For the preoperative planning of segmentectomies, virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence could allow 3-dimensional visualization of the complex anatomy of pulmonary segmental divisions, vascular arborization, and bronchial anatomy. This technology can be applied by surgeons preoperatively to gain better insight into a patient's anatomy for planning segmentectomy. METHODS: In this prospective observational pilot study, we aim to assess and demonstrate the technical feasibility and clinical applicability of the first dedicated artificial intelligence-based and immersive 3-dimensional-VR platform (PulmoVR; jointly developed and manufactured by Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery [Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands], MedicalVR [Amsterdam, The Netherlands], EVOCS Medical Image Communication [Fysicon BV, Oss, The Netherlands], and Thirona [Nijmegen, The Netherlands]) for preoperative planning of video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomies. RESULTS: A total of 10 eligible patients for segmentectomy were included in this study after referral through the institutional thoracic oncology multidisciplinary team. PulmoVR was successfully applied as a supplementary imaging tool to perform video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomies. In 40% of the cases, the surgical strategy was adjusted due to the 3-dimensional-VR-based evaluation of anatomy. This underlines the potential benefit of additional VR-guided planning of segmentectomy for both surgeon and patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the successful development and clinical application of the first dedicated artificial intelligence and VR platform for the planning of pulmonary segmentectomy. This is the first study that shows an immersive virtual reality-based application for preoperative planning of segmentectomy to the best of our knowledge.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has become a standard approach for the treatment of lung cancer. However, its minimally invasive nature limits the field of view and reduces tactile feedback. These limitations make it vital that surgeons thoroughly familiarize themselves with the patient's anatomy preoperatively. We have developed a virtual reality (VR) surgical navigation system using head-mounted displays (HMD). The aim of this study was to investigate the potential utility of this VR simulation system in both preoperative planning and intraoperative assistance, including support during thoracoscopic sublobar resection. METHODS: Three-dimensional (3D) polygon data derived from preoperative computed tomography data was loaded into BananaVision software developed at Colorado State University and displayed on an HMD. An interactive 3D reconstruction image was created, in which all the pulmonary structures could be individually imaged. Preoperative resection simulations were performed with patient-individualized reconstructed 3D images. RESULTS: The 3D anatomic structure of pulmonary vessels and a clear vision into the space between the lesion and adjacent tissues were successfully appreciated during preoperative simulation. Surgeons could easily evaluate the real patient's anatomy in preoperative simulations to improve the accuracy and safety of actual surgery. The VR software and HMD allowed surgeons to visualize and interact with real patient data in true 3D providing a unique perspective. CONCLUSIONS: This initial experience suggests that a VR simulation with HMD facilitated preoperative simulation. Routine imaging modalities combined with VR systems could substantially improve preoperative planning and contribute to the safety and accuracy of anatomic resection.},

Although virtual reality headsets have been used in many medical contexts, they have not been used in chest wall resection planning. DESCRIPTION: We compared preoperative planning of a chest wall surgical resection for lung cancer treatment between senior and resident surgeons who used an immersive virtual reality device and a 2-dimensional computed tomography. EVALUATION: Chest wall resection planning was more accurate when surgeons used virtual reality vs computed tomography analysis (28.6% vs 18.3%, P = .018), and this was particularly true in the resident surgeon group (27.4% vs 8.3%, P = .0025). Predictions regarding the need for chest wall substitutes were also more accurate when they were made using virtual reality vs computed tomography analysis in all groups (96% vs 68.5%, P < .0001). Other studied parameters were not affected by the use of the virtual reality tool. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality may offer enhanced accuracy for chest wall resection and reconstruction planning for lung cancer treatment.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to validate a novel medical virtual reality (VR) platform used for medical image segmentation and contouring in radiation oncology and 3D anatomical modeling and simulation for planning medical interventions, including surgery. The first step of the validation was to verify quantitatively and qualitatively that the VR platform can produce substantially equivalent 3D anatomical models, image contours, and measurements to those generated with existing commercial platforms. To achieve this, a total of eight image sets and 18 structures were segmented using both VR and reference commercial platforms. The image sets were chosen to cover a broad range of scanner manufacturers, modalities, and voxel dimensions. The second step consisted of evaluating whether the VR platform could provide efficiency improvements for target delineation in radiation oncology planning. To assess this, the image sets for five pediatric patients with resected standard-risk medulloblastoma were used to contour target volumes in support of treatment planning of craniospinal irradiation, requiring complete inclusion of the entire cerebral–spinal volume. Structures generated in the VR and the commercial platforms were found to have a high degree of similarity, with dice similarity coefficient ranging from 0.963 to 0.985 for high-resolution images and 0.920 to 0.990 for lower resolution images. Volume, cross-sectional area, and length measurements were also found to be in agreement with reference values derived from a commercial system, with length measurements having a maximum difference of 0.22 mm, angle measurements having a maximum difference of 0.04°, and cross-sectional area measurements having a maximum difference of 0.16 mm2. The VR platform was also found to yield significant efficiency improvements, reducing the time required to delineate complex cranial and spinal target volumes by an average of 50% or 29 min.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lately, increased interest in pulmonary segmentectomy has been observed. Segmental border identification is extremely difficult on 2-dimensional computed tomography (CT). Preoperative application of virtual reality (VR) can provide better insight into patient-specific anatomy. The aim of this study was to investigate the added clinical value of 3-dimensional (3D) VR using PulmoVR for preoperative planning. METHODS: Patients with an indication for pulmonary segmentectomy were included between June 2020 and September 2021 at the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. CT scans were (semi)automatically segmented to visualize lung segments, segmental arteries, veins, and bronchi. Three surgeons made a surgical plan on the basis of the conventional CT scan and subsequently analyzed the VR visualization. The primary outcome was the incidence of critical (ensuring radical resection) preoperative plan modifications. Secondarily, data on observed anatomic variation and perioperative (oncologic) outcomes were collected. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients (median age at surgery, 65 years [interquartile range, 17.25 years]) with an indication for pulmonary segmentectomy were included. After supplemental VR visualization, the surgical plan was adjusted in 52%; the tumor was localized in a different segment in 14%, more lung-sparing resection was planned in 10%, and extended segmentectomy, including 1 lobectomy, was planned in 28%. Pathologic examination confirmed radical resection in 49 patients (98%). CONCLUSIONS: This 3D VR technology showed added clinical value in the first 50 VR-guided segmentectomies because a 52% change of plan with 98% radical resection was observed. Furthermore, 3D VR visualization of the bronchovasculature, including various anatomic variations, provided better insight into patient-specific anatomy and offered lung-sparing possibilities with more certainty.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the benefits of a virtual reality (VR) environment with a head-mounted display (HMD) for decision-making in liver surgery. BACKGROUND: Training in liver surgery involves appraising radiologic images and considering the patient's clinical information. Accurate assessment of 2D-tomography images is complex and requires considerable experience, and often the images are divorced from the clinical information. We present a comprehensive and interactive tool for visualizing operation planning data in a VR environment using a head-mounted-display and compare it to 3D visualization and 2D-tomography. METHODS: Ninety medical students were randomized into three groups (1:1:1 ratio). All participants analyzed three liver surgery patient cases with increasing difficulty. The cases were analyzed using 2D-tomography data (group "2D"), a 3D visualization on a 2D display (group "3D") or within a VR environment (group "VR"). The VR environment was displayed using the "Oculus Rift ™" HMD technology. Participants answered 11 questions on anatomy, tumor involvement and surgical decision-making and 18 evaluative questions (Likert scale). RESULTS: Sum of correct answers were significantly higher in the 3D (7.1 ± 1.4, p < 0.001) and VR (7.1 ± 1.4, p < 0.001) groups than the 2D group (5.4 ± 1.4) while there was no difference between 3D and VR (p = 0.987). Times to answer in the 3D (6:44 ± 02:22 min, p < 0.001) and VR (6:24 ± 02:43 min, p < 0.001) groups were significantly faster than the 2D group (09:13 ± 03:10 min) while there was no difference between 3D and VR (p = 0.419). The VR environment was evaluated as most useful for identification of anatomic anomalies, risk and target structures and for the transfer of anatomical and pathological information to the intraoperative situation in the questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: A VR environment with 3D visualization using a HMD is useful as a surgical training tool to accurately and quickly determine liver anatomy and tumor involvement in surgery.},
