\section{INTRODUCTION}

Accurate visuospatial conversion of 2D medical images into 3D mental models is essential in clinical practice. However, such skills are challenging to acquire and require significant cognitive effort, especially for novice medical practitioners. Immersive 3D visualizations of surigcal amaotmy in Virtual reality (VR) have been explored to facilitate visuospatial udnerstanding, preoperative planning, and interprofessional collaboration. \cite{RN86} developed a 3D heart model for medical education in a semi-immersive environment with navigational tools. \cite{RN5} demonstrated that 3D-VR is a valid tool for teaching surgical anatomy in unique patient case and adds more enjoyment to the learning process. LapSim \cite{RN90} provided a realistic stimulation for thoracoscopic surgeries and especially benefited the novices without prior experience. In the context of patient-specific preoperative evaluation, \cite{RN83} proposed an immersive presentation of medical volume data for liver surgery planning. CollaVRLap \cite{RN26} additionally implemented the co-presence of an assistant to stimulate for cooperation in laparoscopic liver surgery training. \cite{RN6} further delinated a VR environment focusing on collaborative virtual resection for liver surgery, either in remote or co-located environment. For thoracic anatomy, PulmoVR \cite{RN10, RN13} combined VR with semi-automatic segmentation for immersive planning of lung surgeries, and demonstrated clinical benefits in optimizing surgical plans. Similarly, \cite{RN44} showcased the improvements in understading and planning accuracy provided by VR for residents surgeons.
%VisCubeSX \cite{RN85} improved the resident knowledge of pelvic anatomy compared to traditional methods.
% Ujiie et al. (2021) developed a VR simulation system for thoracic surgery, emphasizing its utility in preoperative planning and intraoperative assistance. 
%Elucis \cite{RN84} validated a VR platform for 3D anatomical modeling and contouring in radiation oncology and surgical planning, showing substantial efficiency improvements and high similarity to existing commercial platforms. 
%Kunz et al. (2024) assessed the use of VR for understanding and evaluating anatomical data in pancreatic cancer resectability, highlighting the potential for more accurate staging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Despite these advancements, current VR systems face several gaps and limitations, including inadequate interaction capabilities, limited visualization of patient data, and insufficient support for collaborative planning among multidisciplinary teams. Additionally, there is a need for high-fidelity 3D models in real-time, interactive environments to facilitate comprehensive surgical planning, and thorough validation is required to ensure their effectiveness in clinical applications. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel VR surgical planning system designed to enhance preoperative planning accuracy and efficiency through immersive 3D visualizations of patient-specific anatomy. The system supports real-time, interactive collaboration among multidisciplinary teams and involves semi-automatic segmentation and manual refinement to generate high-fidelity 3D models, optimized using mesh processing techniques. Initial validation through a pilot study demonstrated the system’s functional accuracy and potential to improve surgical outcomes.
